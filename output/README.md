# CitiBike Data Analysis for Impact of COVID-19 on Trip Duration and Frequency

---

The program returns two types of outputs:
* graphs and plots of monthly number of trips and average monthly duration for each (sub)category (labeled 1-4)
* tabulated predictions for a particular month(s) -- in this instance: December 2020 (labeled 5)

Each of the outputs are presented as part of the program, but they are also stored here for quicker access, given how long it takes the program to run.
